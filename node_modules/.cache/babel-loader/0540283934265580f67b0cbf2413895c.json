After going through an internship at NASA JPL, I realized that I wanted something more fast-pace. In the end, I started a startup with my buddy Lambert in my senior year of college (2016).</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>The startup (called Point) was the first autocomplete on email. We enjoyed some quick growth, went through YC, raised $1.2m, hired 8 people, and got 3 acquisition offers. Unfortunately, the company failed after Gmail Smart Compose got released -- but hey, can't win every time!</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>I then started a new business with one of my investors from Point. We essentially started automating digital make-up for Hollywood. Things were going great (signed a letter-of-intent within 2 weeks of starting), but the COVID thing happened, and we had to stop. </p>\r\n\r\n        <p>I then got hired by Yin Wu at Pulley, and I'm super stoked to see where we can take this company together!

I was driving, and it was 100% my fault. Still got in though ;)</li>\r\n          <li>I was on the Polish National U17 team for judo</li>\r\n          <li>I speak 4 languages. None of them particularly well though</li>\r\n          <li>I did fluid dynamics research on tiny droplets bouncing on a sheet of liquid. They model quantum mechanics particularly well.</li>\r\n          <li>I came 4th in an international safe-cracking tournament (as part of a team, to be precise)</li>\r\n          <li>I have a serious Nutella problem. I once ate 3.3 lbs (1.5 kg) of Nutella over two days. It was the only thing I ate that weekend</li>\r\n          <li>For those concerned with my health: I no longer buy Nutella</li>\r\n          <li>I used to build model rockets. Most of them exploded on the ground. Fortunately, I decided to not pursue it as a career</li>\r\n          <li>My personality was described as \"human labrador\". I take pride in that.</li>        \r\n        </ul>\r\n      \r\n        <h4>Stats about me</h4>\r\n          <Table responsive=\"lg\" bordered striped>\r\n            <tbody>\r\n              <tr>\r\n                <td>Height</td><td>5'9</td>\r\n              </tr>\r\n              <tr>\r\n                <td>Weight</td><td>180 lbs</td>\r\n              </tr>\r\n              <tr><td></td><td></td></tr>\r\n            </tbody>\r\n          </Table>      \r\n\r\n\r\n        <h4></h4>\r\n      </div>\r\n    )\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n    \r\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
